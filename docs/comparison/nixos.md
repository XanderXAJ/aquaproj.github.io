Nix OS is a package manager. On the other hand, aqua isn't a package manager.
aqua doesn't manage dependencies.

Nix OS builds reproducible, declarative and reliable systems.

aqua is simple and easy to use.
This is important to introduce aqua in a team and project.

Furthermore, you can update tools easily with Renovate. aqua is CI friendly. You can add a tool to the Standard Registry easily.

On the other hand, Nix OS is too complicated to introduce it to team and project.
