# Nix OS

:warning: Note that we aren't familiar with Nix OS.

https://nixos.org/

> Nix is a tool that takes a unique approach to package management and system configuration.

Nix OS is a package manager. On the other hand, clivm isn't a package manager.
clivm doesn't manage dependencies.

Nix OS builds reproducible, declarative and reliable systems.

clivm is simple and easy to use.
This is important to introduce clivm in a team and project.

Furthermore, you can update tools easily with Renovate. clivm is CI friendly. You can add a tool to the Standard Registry easily.

On the other hand, Nix OS is too complicated to introduce it to team and project.
Compared with clivm, the learning cost is high.
If your team is small and every member has high technical skill, this may not be a problem.

The scope and goal of clivm are different from Nix OS.
