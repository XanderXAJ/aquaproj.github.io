# pyenv, rbenv, tfenv, and etc

## Pros

These tools are specialized for the specific tool such as Python, Ruby, and Terraform.
clivm is more general.
clivm is written in Go, so clivm doesn't depend on the specific shell.

## Cons

clivm doesn't support building the tool when installing. So clivm doesn't support tools which the build is required.
